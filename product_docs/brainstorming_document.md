# Rescue Ranger Brainstorming Document

## Overview
The Rescue Ranger application will assist horse rescues in the care and coordination of their animals. The application should eventually cover all aspects of horse rescue functionality, from keeping track of animal information to reports about the animals, volunteers, facilities, etc.

## Horse Care: Detailed Brainstorming for Mobile-First Rescue App

### Horse Profiles: Deep Data Capture

- Basic details: name, photo, breed, color, sex, microchip, markings, foaling date, origin, age (calculated if date of birth is known), date of birth (sometimes not known).
- Status and tracking: intake date, acquisition reason (surrender, seizure, stray), rescue/foster/adoption status.
- Special needs: temperament, behavioral notes, training history, allergies or sensitivities.
- Current housing: stall number, barn location name.
- Current turnout location: Paddock name, letter or number.

### Feeding & Nutrition

- Feed schedules: types of feed (often combined), amount of water to add to feed, forage, supplements, medications to be added to feed, eating times.
- Logging feed changes (product, amount, frequency), reasons (veterinary advice, weight change).
- Weight/body condition tracking and adjustment history.
- Water intake logs, especially in hot weather or for horses at risk of colic.
- Alerts for special diets (Cushing’s, metabolic syndrome, allergies).

### Medical Care

- Vaccination records: schedule (core and risk-based), reminders, history.
- Deworming: product, date, target parasites, results of fecal egg counts.
- Medical conditions: chronic issues (laminitis, COPD, arthritis), episode logs, treatment plans.
- Injuries or illnesses: diagnosis, ongoing symptom logs, medication/treatment records.
- Vitals tracking: temperature, pulse, respiration, mucous membrane color, gut sounds.

### Dental Care

- Dental examination history (date, findings, photos if available).
- Floating and procedures: practitioner, sedation used, tooth charts.
- Notes on bite issues, difficulty eating, or behavior changes linked to dental pain.
- Schedule and track next planned dental visit, with overdue alerts.

### Farrier Care

- Hoof trim/shoeing schedule per horse.
- Farrier notes: hoof conformation, issues (e.g., white line disease, abscesses), shoe type used, corrective work done.
- Photographic hoof records pre/post farrier work.
- Owner/farrier/manager communication log for hoof care.

### Daily Care & Wellness

- Detailed daily log options: appetite, manure frequency/consistency, hydration, mood, turnout/exercise, new behaviors.
- Turnout rotation: pasture vs. paddock, companions, length of turnout.
- Grooming records: schedule, skin/coat condition, tips for identifying parasite infestation (lice/ticks).
- Parasite management: treatments (topical, systemic), assessment results.
- Grooming schedule: when and how often grooming is performed.
- Temperature considerations
   - If the real-feel temperature is too hot, horses often stay inside
   - If the real-feel temperature is too cold, horses often wear a sheet or a blanket

### Behavioral & Training

- Baseline temperament, changes or triggers to flag (e.g., aggression, withdrawal).
- Program for socialization, groundwork, enrichment activities.
- Training and progress notes, customizable goals/milestones.
- Log interventions for behavioral issues, responses.

### Emergency Care

- Store and highlight emergency contacts (vet, farrier, key staff).
- Quick-access action lists for colic, injury, severe weather, evacuation.
- Option to flag at-risk horses for medical/behavioral emergencies.

### Adoption, Fostering & Transfer

- Adoption eligibility checklist: health, training, behavioral assessments.
- Home visit/inspection notes for potential adopters.
- Post-adoption follow-up schedule, outcomes and notes.
- Legal agreements storage (adoption, foster, relinquishment).

### End-of-Life & Memoriam

- Quality-of-life scoring/logs.
- Decision tracking for euthanasia (consultation notes, team input, scheduling).
- Final vet, cremation, or burial documentation.
- Memorial notes/photos for organizational and supporter remembrance.

### Staff, Volunteer & Visitor Interaction Logs

- Caregiver shift notes/handovers per horse.
- Feedback or observations from visitors, volunteers, trainers.

### Automated Alerts & Reminders

- Critical medication reminders, urgent care tasks.
- Proactive alerts for seasonal/vaccination trends (e.g., spring/fall shots, fly control).
- Flag lapses in logging or overdue tasks for prompt attention.

### Documentation & Compliance

- Attach test results, vet documents, adoption forms to horse profiles.
- Track regulatory requirements (Coggins, health certificates).
- Audit logs for all record changes.

This expanded brainstorming list ensures a robust foundation for the application to support nuanced, real-world needs in equine rescue settings. These details should drive both the user interface and backend data model, allowing rescue organizations to provide high-quality, individualized care with confidence and accountability.
