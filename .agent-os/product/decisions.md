## 2025-08-14: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

Launch Rescue Ranger as a comprehensive horse rescue management platform targeting small to medium-sized rescue organizations (10-100 horses). The product will focus on solving critical operational challenges through mobile-first design, offline capability, and role-based interfaces tailored to different user types within rescue organizations.

### Context

Horse rescue organizations currently operate with fragmented systems including paper records, spreadsheets, and verbal communication. This leads to missed medications, coordination inefficiencies, and compliance challenges. The market lacks purpose-built solutions for equine rescue operations, with existing farm management apps failing to address specific needs like temperature-based care decisions, complex medication schedules, and volunteer coordination across multiple daily shifts.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Generic Farm Management Platform**
   - Pros: Broader market appeal, existing solutions to build upon, simpler requirements
   - Cons: Lacks horse-specific features, poor fit for rescue operations, would require extensive customization

2. **Veterinary Practice Management Extension**
   - Pros: Strong medical records capabilities, existing integrations, professional credibility
   - Cons: Too complex for volunteers, expensive licensing, lacks operational features

3. **Simple Task Management App**
   - Pros: Easy to build, quick to market, low complexity
   - Cons: Insufficient for compliance needs, no medical tracking, lacks specialized features

### Rationale

The decision to build a purpose-specific platform for horse rescues is driven by:
- Clear market need with no adequate existing solutions
- Manageable target market size allowing for focused development
- High impact potential for animal welfare
- Strong differentiation through domain expertise
- Feasible technical requirements with modern web technologies

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- First-mover advantage in underserved market
- Direct impact on animal welfare outcomes
- Clear value proposition for sales and marketing
- Potential for recurring revenue through SaaS model
- Opportunity to expand to other animal rescue types

**Negative:**
- Limited initial market size may constrain growth
- Requires deep domain knowledge to build effectively
- Need for extensive user research and testing
- Dependency on reliable offline synchronization technology

## 2025-08-14: Technology Stack Selection

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Adopt .NET 9 with PostgreSQL for backend, Vue.js 3 with Quasar for frontend, deployed on Digital Ocean infrastructure. This stack prioritizes developer productivity, long-term maintainability, and cost-effectiveness for a startup environment.

### Context

The application requires a robust, scalable architecture supporting multi-tenancy, offline capability, and real-time synchronization. The tech stack must balance modern capabilities with practical considerations like developer availability, hosting costs, and long-term support.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Node.js/React/MongoDB Stack**
   - Pros: Large ecosystem, JavaScript throughout, flexible schema
   - Cons: Less structured for complex business logic, weaker multi-tenancy support

2. **Ruby on Rails/PostgreSQL**
   - Pros: Rapid development, convention over configuration, mature ecosystem
   - Cons: Performance concerns at scale, declining developer pool

3. **Java Spring Boot/Angular**
   - Pros: Enterprise-grade, strong typing, extensive tooling
   - Cons: Higher complexity, slower development cycle, resource intensive

### Rationale

.NET 9 provides enterprise-grade capabilities with modern developer experience. PostgreSQL offers robust multi-tenancy through schemas. Vue.js 3 with Quasar enables rapid mobile-first development. Digital Ocean provides cost-effective hosting with good PostgreSQL management tools.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Strong typing reduces bugs in complex business logic
- Excellent tooling and IDE support
- Long-term support from Microsoft
- Cost-effective hosting options
- Good availability of .NET developers

**Negative:**
- Requires expertise in both .NET and JavaScript ecosystems
- Initial setup complexity for multi-tenancy
- Potential vendor lock-in with Azure services
